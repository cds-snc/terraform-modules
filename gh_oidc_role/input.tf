  claim: The claim that the token is allowed to be authorized from. 
  This allows you to further restrict where this role is allowed to be used.
  If you wanted to restrict to the main branch you could use a value like `ref:refs/heads/main`, if you don't want to restrict you can use `*`

  **Please Note:** You need to provide at least one role for this module to work.
