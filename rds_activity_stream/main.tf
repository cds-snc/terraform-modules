/* 
* # RDS Activity Stream
*
* Creates an RDS activity stream that has its events written to an S3 bucket for auditting.  By default the activity stream is [asynchronous to prioritize database performance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/DBActivityStreams.Overview.html#DBActivityStreams.Overview.sync-mode). 
* 
* This is accomplished with a Kinesis Firehose that reads from the activity stream and uses a Lambda function to decrypts the records before they are written to the bucket.  The design is based on [a recommended AWS architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/DBActivityStreams.Overview.html#DBActivityStreams.Overview.how-they-work).
* 
* âš  **Note:** Docker is required for the `terraform apply` to download the Lambda function's Python dependencies.
