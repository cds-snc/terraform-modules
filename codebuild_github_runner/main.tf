/* 
* # CodeBuild GitHub runner
* Creates an AWS CodeBuild project that allows you to self-host serverless GitHub action runners.
*
* ## Authentication
* It is recommended that you create a [fine-grained personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) so that you can scope the permissions down to only what is required. The PAT should have the following permissions:
*
* - `Actions (read/write)`: required
* - `Administration (read/write)`: required
* - `Commit statuses (read/write)`: required
* - `Contents (read/write)`: optional, depends on runner tasks
* - `Metadata (read)`: required
* - `Pull requests (read/write)`: optional, depends on runner tasks
* - `Secrets (read)`: optional, depends on runner tasks
* - `Variables (read)`: optional, depends on runner tasks
* - `Webhooks (read/write)`: required
*
